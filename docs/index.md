## Why a notebook?

- It's a place for me to jot down my thoughts, ideas, and learnings.
- It's a place for me to organize my knowledge and share it with others.
- It's a place for me to experiment and play.
- It's a place for me to learn and grow.

## What's in this notebook?

This notebook is a collection of notes, articles, tutorials, and other resources on a wide range of topics. Some of the topics I'm interested in include: computer science, programming, distributed system, artificial intelligence, and more. I'm always learning new things, so the content of this notebook will evolve over time. I hope you find something here that interests you! ðŸ˜Š

## Why English?

Writing in English forces me to practice my English skills, which is something I want to improve. But I'm not a native English speaker, so hopefully you'll forgive any mistakes I make. I hope you'll find my writing clear and easy to understand. ðŸ«¡

## Some Statement

Some notes are directly `Ctrl C/V` from Obsidian or Notion, so there might be some formatting issues. I'll try to fix them as soon as possible. ðŸ¥°
