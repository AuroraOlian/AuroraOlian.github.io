# Chapter 9 Relations

## 9.1 Relations and Their Properties & 9.2 n-ary Relations

- *binary relation* from $A$ to $B$ is a subset of $A \times B$
- $R \subseteq A \times B$
- $R=\{(a,b)|a\in A,b\in B,aRb\}$

!!! note "The relationship between *function* and *relation*"

    - Function is a special relation
    - Relations are a generalization of graphs of function.

!!! question "Counting problem"

    How many of relation on a set $A$ is a relation from $A$ to $A$?
    ??? success "Answer"
        $2^{|A|^2}$

### Presenting relations

- list its all ordered pairs
- using a set build notation/specification by predicates
- 2D table
- Connection matrix/zero-one matrix
- Directed graph/Digraph

### properties of relations

- reflexive(自反): $\forall x(x\in A\to(x,x)\in R)$
- irreflexive(反自反): $\forall x(x\in A\to(x,x)\notin R)$
- symmetric(对称): $\forall x\forall y((x,y)\in R\to(y,x)\in R)$
- antisymmetric(反对称): $\forall x\forall y((x,y)\in R\land(y,x)\in R\to x=y)$
- asymmetric(非对称): $\forall x \forall y ((x, y) \in R \rightarrow (y, x) \notin R)$
- transitive(传递): $\forall x\forall y\forall z((x,y)\in R\wedge(y,z)\in R\to(x,z)\in R)$

| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| reflexive<br>$2^{n^2 - n}$                      | All elements on the main diagonal must be 1s.              | There is a loop at every vertex of the directed graph-> each vertex has a loop to itself |
| irreflexive<br>$2^{n^2 - n}$                    | All elements on the main diagonal must be 0s.              | No vertex has a loop to itself                                                           |
| symmetric<br>$2^\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$               | The symmetric positions are both 0 or 1                    | If there is an arc(x, y) there must be an arc(y, x) -> both bidirectional edge           |
| antisymmetric<br>$2^n \cdot  3^\frac{n^2-n}{2}$ | Symmetric positions cannot both be 1 (they can both be 0)  | If there is an arc(x, y) there must be no arc(y, x) -> no bidirectional edge             |

> No general formula that counts the number of transitive relations on a finite set is known

- inverse relation: $R^{-1}=\{ (b,a)\mid(a,b)\in R \}$
- complementary relation: $\overline{R}=\{ (a,b)\mid(a,b)\notin R \}$

!!! note "**When check the property transitive, we can ignore arc(x, x) or loops to itself**"

    - reflexive and irreflexive are not opposites 
        - a relation can be neither reflexive and irreflexive
        - empty relation is reflexive and irreflexive(Only such relation fits!)
    - symmetric and antisymmetric are not opposites
    - transitive doesn't require digraphs has a circle

!!! question

    - What property dose the relation x is a multiple of y on set of **all** integers/**positive** integers have? (NOTE: think carefully about all the properties of relation) 

    ??? success "Answer"
        - on set of **all** integers is reflexive, transitive
        - on set of **positive** integers is reflexive, **antisymmetric**, transitive

### Combining Relations

- the notation $\circ$: take effect from right to left!!!
- $S\circ R=\{(a,c) \mid a\in A\land c\in C\land \exists b(aRb \land bSc)\}$
- $S\circ R \neq R\circ S$
- $S\circ R=M_R\cdot M_S$

- Definition($R^n$): $R_1 = R, R^{n+1} = R^n \circ R$
- By associative law, we have $R^{n+1} = R \circ R^n$
- The relation $R$ on a set $A$ is transitive if and only if $R^n\subseteq R, n=1,2,3,...$

    !!! question "Try to proof it!"

## 9.4 Closures of Relations 关系闭包

- Definition: The closure of $R$ with respect to $P$ is the smallest relation $S$ on $A$ with property $P$ that contains $R$
- smallest? is subset of all subset $A \times A$ containing $R$ with property $P$

### Different Types of Closures

=== "Reflexive Closure"

    - $r(R)=R\cup I_A,I_A=\{(x,x)\mid x\in A\}$
    - $R=R\cup I_A\Leftrightarrow R$ is reflexive

=== "Symmetric Closure"

    - $s(R)=R\cup R^{-1}$
    - $R=R\cup R^{-1} \Leftrightarrow R$ is reflexive

=== "Transitive Closure"

    - $t(R) = R^* = R\cup R^2\cup...UR^k$
    - $t(R) = R^*$ is transitive 
    - How to obtain t(R)?

        - brute solving
        - **Warshall’s Algorithm**(like **Flyid Algorithm**)

### Path

- Let $R$ be a relation on a set $A$. There is a path the of length n, where n is a positive integer, from a to b if and only if $(a, b) \in R^n$  
- Connectivity relation($R^*$), consists of pairs (a, b) such that there is a path (in $R$) from a to b
    $R^*=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty R^n$

!!! note "The suggested order to computing closure"
    s(R) -> t(R) -> r(R)

## 9.5 Equivalence Relations

- equivalence relation ~: relation with property *reflexive*, *symmetric*, and *transitive*
- equivalence class $[a]_R$:

## 9.6 Partial Orderings

- partial order: relation with property *reflexive*, *antisymmetric*, and *transitive*
- partially ordered set/poset $(S, R)$: set of partial order $R$ on set $S$
  
---

- $a \preceq b$: $(a, b) \in R$
- $a \prec b$: $a \preceq b \wedge a \ne b$
- common partial order: $\le, |, \subseteq$

---

- Comparable: $a \preceq b$, or $b \preceq a$
- Incomparable: not comparable

---

- total/linear order: every two elements of $S$ are comparable
- well-ordered set: every nonempty subset of $S has a least element

### Lexicographic Order

$(a_1, a_2) \prec (b_1, b_2)$: $a_1 \prec_1 b_1$ or $a_1 = b_1 \wedge a_2 \prec_2 b_2$

### Hasse Diagram

- *Hasse diagram* is obtained from the digraph for this relation. Below is the procedure:

1. Construct a digraph representation of the poset (S, R)
2. remove all loops(that is, eliminate property *reflexive*)
3. remove all redundant(多余的) edges(that is, eliminate property *transitive*)
4. remove all arrows to obtain an undirected graph

### Maximal and Minimal Elements

- maximal/minimal: $\neg \exists b \in S(a \prec b/b \prec a)$
- greatest/least: $\forall b \in S(b \preceq a/a \preceq b)$

<div class="annotate" markdown>

- upper/lower bound (of a set (1))
- greatest lower bound(g.l.b)/least upper bound(l.u.b)

</div>
1. maybe a subset of given poset

!!! question

    1. The greatest/least element are unique when they exist.
    2. The unique maximal/minimal element is greatest/least element

          2. ×

### Lattices

- lattice: every pair of elements has a l.u.b and a g.l.b

!!! example

    === "ex1"
        
        $(Z, \le)$

        - l.u.b: the larger of the two elements
        - g.l.b: the smallest of the two elements

        !!! note "Every totally ordered set is a lattice."

    === "ex2"

        $(Z^+, |)$

        - l.u.b: the least common multiple 
        - g.l.b: the greatest common divisor

    === "ex3"

        $(P(S), \subseteq)$

        - l.u.b: $S_1 \cup S_2$
        - g.l.b: $S_1 \cap S_2$

!!! question "Determine the g.l.b and l.u.b of the below subsets"

    1. $(P(S), \subseteq)$, where $P(S)$ is the power set of a set S
    2. $(P(S), \supseteq)$, where $P(S)$ is the power set of a set S

    ??? success "answer"

        1. g.l.b: $A \cap B$ & l.u.b: $A \cup B$
        2. g.l.b: $A \cup B$ & l.u.b: $A \cap B$
