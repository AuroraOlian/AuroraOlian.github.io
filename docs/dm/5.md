# Chapter 5 Induction and Recursion

### Mathematical Induction

- BASIS STEP: P(1) is true
- INDUCTIVE STEP: $\forall P(k),  P(k+1)$ is true
- This completes the inductive step. By mathematical induction, ......

### Strong Induction

- BASIS STEP: P(1) is true
- INDUCTIVE STEP: suppose $P(i), 1 \le i \le n$, prove $P(k+1)$ is true
- This completes the inductive step. By strong induction, ......

### Well-ordering Property

- Every nonempty set of nonnegative integers has a least element
